		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have a lot of qualifications, as I am still studying but I have been beginning to explore and try new things on my own. This website is one of them, been practicing Java using Eclipse and learning how to code different type of programs. So far in Java, i have created a basic calculator app that takes user input for what operation and values, calculates the results and outputs it to them before returning to the main menu. I have tried to create a user interface of a game called snake that allows to restart the game or exit but I have not figured it out.

					Unfortantly, since the start of the new winter semester with a heavier course load, I put most of my personal projects on pause. However, since adjusted to the coursework and able to balance my time between everything, I'm going to get back on track with my personal projects.

 		<p>Entering high school, I was just like every other kid, excited and looking forward to next 4 years. I knew I wanted to be in the computer science field so I made sure to take the courses I needed so I never worried about my courses. I mainly focused on making friends, completing and understanding the course load while having fun. I managed to get on honor roll all 4 years, which is a big accomplishment for me because high school was not smooth sailing. Unfortunaly I was not able to achieve certain awards like technology award or math award or anything within a certain subject.

			University
		</h3>
		<p>
			University was a big change and a challenge. It didn't hit me until second semester. I was spending a lot of time in the library doing my studying and didn't spend a lot of time making friends. Towards the end of first semester, I started to spend some more time making friends and getting to know some people. I was still spending time in the library studying but the topics started to get harder and was being difficult to grasp. Over time, I started to reduce my course load and it really helped me. My grades were better and I was managing my time really well. Now, I'm still taking a reduced course load while managing work and my personal projects that I am doing.
